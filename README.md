# Data Analyst Nanodegree, Udacity
### A Bertelsmann-sponsored initiative involved selecting participants for phase one from a pool of 10,000+ applicants and selecting 500+ successful participants from a pool of 3000+  for phase two. Phase 2 selection involved completion of course prerequisite, as well as, active engagement in Slack social events (days of code challenges, helping colleges, and working together to host webinar sessions) as part of Udacity's goal to strengthen our ability to collaborate.

_The projects are stored in different directory in order to mimic Udacity curation of the program_

>* Carried out a study that involved going through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. It started by selecting from a pool of dataset, taking a look at it and brainstorming what questions could be answered using it. Note: Inferential statistics or machine learning were not required for project completion. The process is demonstrated below (Image credit: Udacity Data AnalyticsÂ Nanodegree)
