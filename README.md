# Data Analyst Nanodegree, Udacity

Phase 2 selection involved completion of course prerequisite, as well as, active engagement in Slack social events (days of code challenges, helping colleges, and working together to host webinar sessions) as part of Udacity's goal to strengthen our ability to collaborate.

_The projects are stored in different directory in other to mimic Udacity curation of the program_
