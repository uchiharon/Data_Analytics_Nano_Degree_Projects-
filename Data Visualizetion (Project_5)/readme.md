# Diamonds Data Exploration

## Dataset

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation 
Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated 
by large air carriers. The 2020 first quarter of these data was analysed. 
Varaibles include origin state, dest state, diverted, cancelled, cancellation
code (reason for cancellation :A = carrier,B = weather, C = NAS, D = security) etc.


## Summary of Findings

In this evaluation, I discovered that as majority of the cancelled where due to 
security. This issue started from march 2020.

In addition to this, Mammoth lakes had the high percentage of cancelled which means
that more attention has to be paid to improve the efficiency of this airport.   



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just the cause of cancelled flight originating
from canada. I start by introducing the entire data set and then streamlining it
to flight whose origin is from canada. I made a summary of the canada dataset with a 
pie chart.

Afterwards, I introduce each of the categorical variables one by one. I've made
sure to use different color palettes for each variable to make sure it
is clear that they're different between plots.
